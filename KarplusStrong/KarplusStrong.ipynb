    "A musical sound, to be considered a sound and not just noise, must produce in the listener the sensation of \"pitch\"; when we sing, for instance, the melodic line is carried by the vowels in the lyrics, and not by unvoiced sounds such as \"s\" or \"t\". Pitch in a musical note is determined by the periodic repetition of a pattern in the signal; the nuber of times per second that pattern repeats is called the *frequency* of the note, usually measured in Hertz that has dimension $s^{-1}$. \n",

    "In digital signal processing, all signals are just sequences of numbers, so there is no absolute notion of time; but, when we output a signal via a device such as a soundcard, a fundamental parameter is the number of samples per second that our device ingests: this is called the **sampling rate** of the system.\n",
    "\n",
