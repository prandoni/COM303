Another common term is **dithering**, which is borrowed from digital imaging; the origin of the name is [extremely fascinating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither) in and of itself.\n",

    "A loudspeaker, especially a cheap one, will not be able to vibrate effectively at the low and high ends of the audible spectrum because of the physical limitations of its internal mechanics; at best the magnitude response will be flat up to 20KHz and decay rapidly afterwards. The lowpass characteristic of the loudspeaker is usually accentuated by the presence of limiting capacitors (as in the Spectrum schematics above) that prevent overloading the speaker's coil. \n",

The first spectral line in a square wave of period $P$ with a sampling frequency $F_s$ is going to be at $F_s/P$, independently of duty cycle. If we want to make sure that we don't hear any high-frequency artifacts when using the lowpass trick, we need to use square waves whose first harmonic falls outside of the frequency range of the loudspeaker. This is achieved by using oversampling.\n",

    "Even in early electronic devices, the CPU's clock was in the MHz range; that meant that the bit driving the loudspeaker could be flipped many times faster than the rate required to obtain a sound in the audible range. For instance, the ZX Spectrum's CPU (a Zilog Z80) ran at 3.5MHz; omitting boring details, that means one could output 1-bit samples at about 200KHz which represents a 10-time oversampling with respect to the bandwidth of the loudspeaker. Or, in other words, one could use square waves with varying duty cycles with a period up to 10 samples. \n",
