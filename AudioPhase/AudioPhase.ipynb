We want to avoid normalization so that we keep control over the volume of the sound. A way to do so is to make sure that all audio clips have at least one sample at a pre-defined maximum value, and this value is the same for all clips; to achieve this we add a slow \"tail\" to the data which will not result in an audible sound but will set a common maximum value to all clips."
