    "\n",
    "DTMF signaling is the way analog phones send the number dialed by a user over to the central phone office. This was in the day before all-digital networks and cell phones were the norm, but the method is still used for in-call option selection (\"press 4 to talk to customer service\"...).\n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanism is rather clever: the phone's keypad is arranged in a $4\\times 3$ grid and each button is associated with *two* frequencies according to this table:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "|            | **1209 Hz** | **1336 Hz** | **1477 Hz** |\n",
    "|------------|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|\n",
    "| **697 Hz** |      1      |      2      |      3      |\n",
    "| **770 Hz** |      4      |      5      |      6      |\n",
    "| **852 Hz** |      7      |      8      |      9      |\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The  frequencies in the table have been chosen so that they are \"coprime\"; in other words, no frequency is a multiple of any other, which reduces the probability of erroneously detecting the received signals due to interference. When a button is pressed, the two corresponding frequencies are generated simultaneously and sent over the line. For instance, if the digit '1' is pressed, the generated signal will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    x(t) = \\sin(2\\pi\\cdot 1209\\cdot t) + \\sin(2\\pi\\cdot697\\cdot t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The official specifications for the DTMF standard further stipulate that:\n",
    "\n",
    " * each tone should be at least 65ms long\n",
    " * tones corresponding to successive digits should be separated by a silent gap of at least 65ms\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will build a DTMF decoder based on the Discrete Fourier Transform. \n",
