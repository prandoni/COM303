    "_Modulation_ is a technique used in telecommunication system in order to shift the spectral occupancy of a signal and adapt it to the transmission medium. In AM radio, for instance, a voice signal $s(t)$ whose maximum frequency content is below 10KHz, is modulated into the MHz range for wireless transmission:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    x(t) = s(t)\\cos(2\\pi f_0 t);\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "at the receiver, the $x(t)$ is demodulated to recover $s(t)$. The modulated sinusoid is usually called the _carrier_ while $s(t)$ is the modulating signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider now the well-known trigonometric formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\cos a + \\cos b = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{a + b}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{a-b}{2}\\right);\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "using two sinusoidal signals, we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\cos(\\omega_a n) + \\cos(\\omega_b n) = 2\\cos\\left(\\omega_0 n\\right)\\cos\\left(\\omega_c n\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\omega_0 = (\\omega_a - \\omega_b)/2$ and $\\omega_c = (\\omega_a + \\omega_b)/2$. While the left-hand side describes the sum of two cosines, which is what we obtain if we play two sinusoids together, the right-hand side describes the same signal as a product, that is, as a modulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the frequencies are very close to each other, $\\omega_a \\approx \\omega_b$, then their average will be approximately equal to either of them, that is, $\\omega_c m\\approx \\omega_a \\approx \\omega_b$ while their difference will be very small, that is, the modulating signal at frequency $\\omega_0$ will have a very low frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "When these sinusoids are mapped to real-world frequencies in the audible range, the perceived effect will be that of a single sinusoid whose volume fluctuates in time at a rate inversely proportional to $\\omega_0$. Acoustically, this volume fluctuation is called a frequency _beat_.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Tuning an instrument\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, frequency beats are useful to tune a stringed instrument when a reference tone (such as that of a tuning fork) is available. The idea is to play the reference note and the string at the same time. If the string is playing a frequency in the vicinity of the reference, the composite sound will be perceived as a modulated sinusoid. The number of volume fluctuations per second provide an estimate of the difference in frequency between the two notes."
