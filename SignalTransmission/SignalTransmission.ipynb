    "When an electrical signal is transmitted over a conductive cable, its power is attenuated in a way that is proportional to the length of the cable and, normally, an amplifier at the receiving end is necessary to compensate for this attenuation. For standard copper coaxial cables, the attenuation is approximately 1 dB per mile (that is, 1 dB per 1.6 Km) so that after approximately 32Km the power will have fallen by 20dB or, equivalently, the amplitude of the signal will have decreased by 90%. (Fun fact: the decibel, as a unit of measurement, was in fact *defined* as the expected attenuation induced by one mile of cable; see [**this Wikipedia entry**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel) for a review on the decibel system if you are not familiar with this unit of measurement).\n",

    "When the first transoceanic telephone lines were being designed in the early decades of the 20th century, with a length in excess of 3200Km, it was clear that a single amplifier at the receiving end would not be enough to recover the transmitted signal. The cable therefore was subdivided into a series of 30Km sections, each followed by an underwater *repeating amplifier* designed to compensate for the attenuation introduced by each section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortuantely, however, a transmitted signal is not only attenuated but it is also affected by additive *noise*, which the repeaters amplify as well. If many repeaters are used, the signal to noise ratio at the end of the chain can become too low and the telephone conversation can become unintelligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To formalize the problem, imagine that each cable segment attenuates the signal by a factor $1/G$; then each repeater can restore the signal's amplitude by implementing a gain factor equal to $G$. If $x(t)$ is the original signal, the signal at the input of the first repeater will be\n",
