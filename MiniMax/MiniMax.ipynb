Think of minimax filter design as a budgeting problem: for a given number of coefficients, we need to make sure that the bandpass and bandstop reqirements are fulfilled first, while the error is a consequence of the budget. With a weighting function we can decide to allocate a larger part of the budget to either passband or stopband. \n",
